# Uikitify Gutenberg

Since late 2018, Wordpress has it's (really awesome) Block Editor called Gutenberg out. Now everybody is going for Blocks! But the galore Plugins found on Wordpress all bring their own style with them, cost a lot of money or have thousands of Blocks - but you need only that ONE you were looking for. :trollface:

That's why I created this Plugin. It's based on [Create Guten Block](https://github.com/ahmadawais/create-guten-block), and I had a lot of help with the react Components fom [CO Blocks](https://github.com/godaddy-wordpress/coblocks).

## What's inside?

Please not, that all the text styling and so on can easily included with a theme (look at kids-team Theme for further notes)

:heavy_check_mark: Momentarily, the plugin features the following Blocks:

- Cards
- Accordion (with an option to render it as Tab-Nav on Desktops)
- Alerts
- Buttons

:checkered_flag: Planned, but yet not coded Blocks:

- Column
- Coder
- Description List
- Grid
- Lightbox
- Modal
- Tab/Switcher
- Icon
- Slideshow
- Slider

:question: Maybe coming later:

- Overlay
