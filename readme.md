# Uikitify Gutenberg

Since late 2018, Wordpress has it's (really awesome) Block Editor called Gutenberg out. Now everybody is going for Blocks! But the galore Plugins found on Wordpress all bring their own style with them, cost a lot of money or have thousands of specialized Blocks - but for theme development you need only basic ones. :trollface:

That's why I created this Plugin. It's based on [Create Guten Block](https://github.com/ahmadawais/create-guten-block), and I had a lot of help with the react Components fom [CO Blocks](https://github.com/godaddy-wordpress/coblocks).

## What's inside?

Please not, that all the text styling and so on can easily included with a theme (look at kids-team Theme for further notes)

:heavy_check_mark: Momentarily, the plugin features the following Blocks:

- Cards
- Accordion (with an option to render it as Tab-Nav on Desktops)
- Alerts
- Buttons
- Section / Container
- Grid (including masnory, equal height, seperators, gaps, parallax and different columns on different devices)
- Column
- Progress-Bar
- Image / Cover / Lightbox
- Description List ( with image/icon )
- Modal

:question: Maybe coming later:

- Slideshow
- Slider
